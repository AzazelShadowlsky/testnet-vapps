# vApp Proposal - SmoothDeFiApp

## Project Name
SmoothDeFiApp

## Category
DeFi

## Team / Author
- GitHub: @AzazelShadowlsky
- Discord: AzazelGanz

## Short Description
A simple decentralized app that helps people swap tokens with super low fees and a clean UI.  
Think of it like a mini Uniswap, but easier to use for beginners.

## Motivation
Most DeFi apps are too complicated for new users.  
Our goal is to create a lightweight DApp where users can swap, provide liquidity, and check basic stats without getting lost in technical stuff.

## What We‚Äôre Building
- Token swap (powered by a simple AMM model)  
- Liquidity pool (earn rewards by adding liquidity)  
- Dashboard with balances and history  

We‚Äôre not trying to be the ‚Äúnext big DeFi‚Äù ‚Äî just a fun and useful app to make testnet activity more engaging.

## Tech Stack
- Smart Contracts: Solidity  
- Frontend: React + Tailwind  
- Backend: Node.js (only for indexing and API)  

## Current Progress
- Basic UI mockup ‚úÖ  
- Draft smart contracts ‚úÖ  
- Integration tests (in progress) üöß  

## Roadmap
- Week 1: Finalize contracts + deploy to testnet  
- Week 2: Build frontend + connect wallet  
- Week 3: Add liquidity + swap features  
- Week 4: Polish UI + submit final version  

## Why It‚Äôs Fun / Useful
- Super easy for anyone to try DeFi on testnet  
- Great for onboarding new users into blockchain  
- Clean UI ‚Üí no confusing buttons everywhere üòÖ
